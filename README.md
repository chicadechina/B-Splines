# B-Splines
functions:
basisfunc_NUBS computes basis functions for nonuniform nonrational B-Splines.
closed_NUBS computes the points on closed B-Spline curve at a step of 0.1 per curve segment.
curveDerivative computes the first derivative of the curve, given a certain parameter value of u.
curvePoint computes the point coordinate, given a certain parameter value of u.
